0.8: 2014-10-19
	Notes can be now searched with regular expressions. 
        POSIX.2 basic regular expressions are supported. This was 
        chosen to achieve compatibility with tools such as grep and sed.

	Added manual page memo(1)

0.7: 2014-10-15
        It's now possible to add a note with custom date. For example
	one could do memo -a "Text for the short note" 2014-24-12. If date
	is omitted, current date will be used.
0.6: 2014-10-11
	Initial release. Memo was originally implemented in Java,
	but that was an ugly hack. Version 0.6 is now rewritten in C99
	and has proper support for reading from stdin among other things.
     2014-10-12
        Added "delete all" option. Also fixed unnecessary errors when ~/.memo
        does not exist.

        Applied patches from Jari Aalto. Includes code readability fixes as
        well as improves help.
